<u>because the system restricts the process, the virtual machine runs unstable or cannot run continuously in the background. You need to obtain the shell permission to lift the restriction. Therefore, it is necessary to download [VMOS Assistant] to assist in obtaining Shell permissions. [VMOS Assistant] Only needs to be activated once. After activating it once, you don't need to pay attention to the activation status of the assistant. If VMOS Pro is unstable or cannot run continuously in the background, just activate it again!
Tutorial steps:</u>
1. Connect your phone to WiFi
2. Open the VMOS assistant, and turn on the unopened
first four preparation items.
3. Go to system settings - developer options - wireless debugging - use pairing code to pair the device
4. Swipe down the notification bar to see the operation steps of the VMOS assistant
5. In the notification of the VMOS assistant, enter the
pairing code just displayed
6. complete pairing
What should I do if the startup fails? When the startup fails, you can enter
your relevant information in the pop-up feedback pop-up window. After we receive your feedback, we will adapt and notify
you as soon as nossible

Do I need to start the VMOS assistant service every time?
After the activation is successful, <s>theoretically there is no need to activate again</s>, and after restarting the phone, there is no need to activate again. When VMOS Pro is unstable or cannot run continuously in the background, you can activate it again.
